CAREFUL! This is an alpha-quality library, and APIs are experimental and subject
to breaking change. If you use this, vendor it aggressively. Please give lots of
feedback on the APIs, we know they need work.

This is a library to help with writing code generators that receive protobuf and
write out files. It is a copy of an internal library used in
[Twirp](https://github.com/twitchtv/twirp), provided externally to help people
make their own generators.
